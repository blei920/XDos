# Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Simulation Script — Educational Python Tool 🐍💻

This repository contains a simple yet effective Python script designed to simulate a basic Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This script serves primarily educational and testing purposes, allowing users—especially students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers—to gain a foundational understanding of how DoS attacks function at a technical level by generating multiple requests to a target server or endpoint.

## What is a DoS Attack? ❓🚪

A Denial of Service attack is a cyberattack method aimed at making a network service unavailable by overwhelming it with excessive requests or traffic. Unlike Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which originate from multiple sources simultaneously, a basic DoS attack typically comes from a single machine. Understanding these attack vectors is critical in cybersecurity for developing defensive strategies, stress testing servers, and improving system robustness.

## Purpose and Use Cases 🎯🧪

This script is intended strictly for ethical use and academic exploration. By running this script in controlled environments—such as lab networks or servers where you have explicit permission—you can:

- Experiment with how servers respond to high request volumes 📈  
- Test the limits and resilience of your own web applications or services 🔧  
- Understand the importance of security measures like rate limiting, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems 🛡️  
- Learn the underlying mechanics of network traffic flooding in a hands-on manner 🌊  

## Features ⚙️

- Lightweight Python implementation 🐍: Easy to read, modify, and extend according to your testing needs  
- Customizable target and port 🎯: Specify the IP address or domain and the port number you wish to test  
- Basic packet flooding 🌧️: Sends continuous requests to the target to simulate stress  
- Minimal dependencies 📦: Runs on any system with Python installed without additional libraries  
- Educational comments 📚: Inline explanations to help users understand each part of the code  
- Non-malicious intent 🚫: Designed for learning, not for causing harm
