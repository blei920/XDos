# Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Simulation Script — Educational Python Tool 🐍💻

This repository contains a simple yet effective Python script designed to simulate a basic Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This script serves primarily educational and testing purposes, allowing users—especially students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers—to gain a foundational understanding of how DoS attacks function at a technical level by generating multiple requests to a target server or endpoint.

## What is a DoS Attack? ❓🚪

A Denial of Service attack is a cyberattack method aimed at making a network service unavailable by overwhelming it with excessive requests or traffic. Unlike Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which originate from multiple sources simultaneously, a basic DoS attack typically comes from a single machine. Understanding these attack vectors is critical in cybersecurity for developing defensive strategies, stress testing servers, and improving system robustness.

## Purpose and Use Cases 🎯🧪

This script is intended strictly for ethical use and academic exploration. By running this script in controlled environments—such as lab networks or servers where you have explicit permission—you can:

- Experiment with how servers respond to high request volumes 📈  
- Test the limits and resilience of your own web applications or services 🔧  
- Understand the importance of security measures like rate limiting, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems 🛡️  
- Learn the underlying mechanics of network traffic flooding in a hands-on manner 🌊  

## Features ⚙️

- Lightweight Python implementation 🐍: Easy to read, modify, and extend according to your testing needs  
- Customizable target and port 🎯: Specify the domain you wish to test  
- Basic HTTP flooding 🌧️: Sends continuous requests to the target to simulate stress  
- Minimal dependencies 📦: Runs on any system with Python installed without additional libraries  
- Educational comments 📚: Inline explanations to help users understand each part of the code  
- Non-malicious intent 🚫: Designed for learning, not for causing harm

## Ethical Considerations and Legal Disclaimer ⚠️

IMPORTANT: This script is designed and shared solely for educational purposes and authorized testing. Unauthorized use against servers or networks without permission is illegal and unethical. Misusing this tool can cause real damage and may have legal consequences. Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with all applicable laws and obtain explicit consent before conducting any testing.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started, simply clone the repository, review the code to understand its workings, and run it against servers you own or have permission to test. Always practice responsible cybersecurity and avoid any actions that may disrupt legitimate services.

## How to Run XDos on Termux 🚀

1. Open Termux 📱  
2. Clone the XDos Repository 🧬  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blei920/XDos.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the Project Folder 📁  
   ```bash
   cd XDos
   ```

4. Run the Script 🐍  
   ```bash
   python XDos.py
   ```


## How to Use the Arguments ⚙️

To launch an attack (for testing/educational purposes only), use the format below:

   ```bash
python XDos.py -u <CHANGE THIS TO TARGET URL> -r 100 -m GET --fast --proxy <CHANGE THIS TO YOUR PROXY> --refer "https://bing.com"
```

⚠️ Replace:
- <CHANGE THIS TO TARGET URL> with the actual target URL (remove the < >)
- <CHANGE THIS TO YOUR PROXY> with your working proxy (remove the < >)

Example:

   ```bash
python XDos.py -u https://example.com -r 100 -m GET --fast --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 --refer "https://bing.com"
```

⚠️ Disclaimer: This tool is for **educational and authorized testing only**. Do not target websites you don’t own or have permission to test.
